# Html-Css. Project 1 Fixe page
This folder contains all my html,css projects. and correlative technologies.

## Description: 
In this specific case, it is an example of a fixed page. We used a file "html" and "css" bases so that you see a clear differentiation of the general structure of a web page as the first scheme. This page has no more information than what is shown on the screen, it contains drop-down menus with a minimum interaction.it is just a practical exercise.
This exercise only aims to differentiate the parts of a page and demonstrate a general mastery of html and css code.
